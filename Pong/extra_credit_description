Initial Direction:
The ball's initial direction can be one of four options (upright, downright, upleft, downleft).
The direction is randomly chosen. (uses the random lib)

Ball Color:
The ball changes to a random color every time it hits a paddle. (uses the random lib)
I make sure that this color is never too similar to the background color.

Acceleration:
The ball slightly accelerates in the direction of the paddle's motion.

Guns:
Each of the paddles has a gun! The guns have a reload time of one half second. (uses the time lib)
If a bullet hits a ball that is coming towards the shooter, the ball changes direction.
The left paddle shoots with X, the right shoots with L

Score:
The score is displayed on the screen.
The score resets when a new game starts.
